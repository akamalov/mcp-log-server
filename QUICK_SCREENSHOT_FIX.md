# Quick Screenshot Fix

## ⚡ Fast Fix for README Screenshots

### Save these files manually:

1. **Dashboard** → `docs/images/screenshots/dashboard.png`
2. **Log Viewer** → `docs/images/screenshots/log-viewer.png`  
3. **Agent Manager** → `docs/images/screenshots/agent-manager.png`
4. **Enhanced Analytics** → `docs/images/screenshots/enhanced-analytics.png`

### Then run these commands:

```bash
# Add the image files
git add docs/images/screenshots/*.png

# Commit the screenshots
git commit -m "docs: Add application screenshots to README"

# Push to repository  
git push origin master
```

### ✅ That's it! 

The README.md is already configured with the correct paths. Once you add the PNG files, the screenshots will display properly.

**Why manual?** The AI assistant cannot directly save binary image files, only text files. But all the structure and paths are ready!
